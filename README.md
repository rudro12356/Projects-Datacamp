# Projects-Datacamp
Practise projects for upskilling on data analysis, data science and machine learning. I'lldo some guided and unguided projects from Datacamp to get hands-on learning. At this point, I am bored following tutorials. 
Discontinuing this series as I don't have the subscription and can't afford it for the moment.
